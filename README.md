# Frontend Folder Structure Guide

This guide provides a map and detailed explanation of the frontend folder structure. Its purpose is to help developers quickly understand the layout, find files, and debug issues efficiently.

## Configuration Files (Root)

### `.env.local`
- **Purpose**: Stores local environment variables. This file is not committed to version control and is used for sensitive information like API keys.
- **Debugging**: When facing connection issues with the backend, verify the API URL and other variables here are correct for your local setup.

### `.gitignore`
- **Purpose**: Specifies which files and folders should be ignored by Git. This typically includes `node_modules`, `.next`, and `.env.local`.
- **Development**: Ensure any new build artifacts or temporary files are added here to keep the repository clean.

### `eslint.config.mjs`
- **Purpose**: Configures ESLint, a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
- **Development**: Helps maintain code quality and consistency. Run `npm run lint` to check for issues.

### `next-env.d.ts`
- **Purpose**: TypeScript declaration file automatically generated by Next.js to ensure Next.js types are picked up by the TypeScript compiler.
- **Development**: You should not need to modify this file.

### `next.config.ts`
- **Purpose**: Configuration file for Next.js. Used to customize settings like redirects, headers, and environment variables.
- **Debugging**: If you have issues with routing, image optimization, or other Next.js features, check this file.

### `package.json` & `package-lock.json` / `yarn.lock`
- **Purpose**: `package.json` lists project dependencies and scripts. The lock files (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) ensure that the same dependency versions are installed across all environments.
- **Debugging**: Dependency-related issues can often be resolved by deleting `node_modules` and the lock file, then running `npm install` or `yarn install` again.

### `postcss.config.mjs`
- **Purpose**: Configuration for PostCSS, a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins. Often used with Tailwind CSS.
- **Debugging**: If you have issues with CSS styling or utilities not being applied, check this file and its associated plugins.

### `tsconfig.json`
- **Purpose**: TypeScript compiler configuration. Defines options like the target JavaScript version, module system, and path aliases.
- **Debugging**: Type errors and module resolution issues can often be traced back to this file. Check the `paths` and `baseUrl` for correct aliasing.

---

## `public/` Folder

- **Purpose**: Stores static assets that are publicly accessible, such as images, fonts, and SVGs. Files in this folder are served from the root URL.
- **Development**: Place any static files your components need to reference directly here. For example, an image at `public/logo.png` can be accessed at `/logo.png`.

---

## `src/` Folder

The `src` directory contains the core application code.

### `src/app/`
- **Purpose**: The heart of the Next.js App Router. This folder contains all pages, layouts, and API routes.
- **File Naming**:
    - `layout.tsx`: Defines a UI that is shared across multiple pages.
    - `page.tsx`: The main UI for a specific route.
    - `loading.tsx`: A loading UI to show while a page's content is loading.
    - `error.tsx`: An error UI to show when an error occurs.
    - `route.ts`: For creating API endpoints.

#### `src/app/api/`
- **Purpose**: Contains API routes for the application, allowing the frontend to make requests to the server-side code running in the same project.
- **`auth/[...all]/route.ts`**: This is a catch-all API route for authentication, likely handling login, logout, and session management.

#### `src/app/login/` and `src/app/tasks/`
- **Purpose**: These folders represent different pages in the application. The folder structure maps directly to the URL path.
- **`[id]/`**: The square brackets indicate a dynamic route. In `tasks/[id]`, `id` would be a parameter representing the task's unique identifier.

### `src/components/`
- **Purpose**: Contains reusable React components used throughout the application.
- **Development**: Breaking the UI into smaller, reusable components makes the code easier to manage and test. When you build a new UI element, consider if it can be a generic component and place it here.
- **Files**:
    - `AuthProvider.tsx`: Wraps the application to provide authentication state (e.g., user is logged in).
    - `ErrorBoundary.tsx`: A safety net to catch rendering errors in its child components and display a fallback UI.
    - `Header.tsx`: The top navigation bar of the application.
    - `TaskCard.tsx`, `TaskForm.tsx`: Components specific to the "task" feature.
    - `LoadingSpinner.tsx`, `Toast.tsx`: General-purpose UI components.

### `src/hooks/`
- **Purpose**: Stores custom React hooks. Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.
- **`useApiStatus.ts`**: A good example of a custom hook that could manage loading, success, and error states for API calls, reducing boilerplate in components.

### `src/lib/`
- **Purpose**: A library folder for helper functions, utility classes, and code that is not a React component or hook.
- **Files**:
    - `api.ts`: Contains functions for making requests to the backend API. Centralizing this logic makes it easier to manage headers, error handling, and authentication tokens.
    - `auth-client.ts`, `auth-server.ts`, `auth.ts`: These files likely separate authentication logic that runs only on the client, only on the server, or on both. This is crucial in Next.js for handling server-side rendering and client-side interactions correctly.

### `src/types/`
- **Purpose**: Contains TypeScript type definitions.
- **`task.ts`**: Defines the shape of the `Task` object. Centralizing types makes them reusable and ensures consistency across the application.
- **Debugging**: If you are getting type errors related to data shapes (e.g., a property is missing or has the wrong type), this is the first place to check.
